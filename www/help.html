  <h4>About:</h4>
  <p>This shiny application tries to match up a set of SAT reading, writing and math scores to the closest universities where students of similar scores fall at the chosen percentile of all accepted students.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>The data for this application has been downloaded from the Scorecard Data published by the U.S. Department of Education at the URL <a href="https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/">https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/</a></p>
  <br/>
  <h4>Details:</h4>
  <p>Students often worry about which institution they might fit in the best given their SAT scores and their individual preferences. Let us, for example, take the case of Ronnie, a student who has SAT scores of 710 in Reading, 720 in Writing and 730 in Math. Ronnie feels that he would be more comfortable and successful if the institution he goes to has students of very similar scores at the middle point (median) of all accepted candidates.</p>
  <br/>
  <p>So Ronnie may enter his scores in the left hand input panel of the application and choose his preferred percentile rank as 50. When he hits the "Find Button", the application would search the available database for all institutions that have a sum of absolute deviation of SAT scores from Ronnie's scores reported upto a threshold of 60. The SAT score used would be the reported scores of the 50th percentile of accepted candidates for the college. The application would then display these institutes ordered by this absolute difference, so the closest match is at the top. The application would only show the top few matches (the number is configurable as an input, defaults to 20) in order to avoid showing too many institutes. The application also shows these institutes on a map with a color and size scaling that differentiates the closeness of the match</p>
  <br/>
  <p>If Rishi, on the other hand has the same scores, but feels that he can be more successful by being in a place where most of his peers have a better score, he can choose the preferred percentile as 25 and run the same search.</p>

  <h4>Disclaimer:</h4>
  <p>1. The Color Bar in the map does not show in Firefox. This is a problem with the shinyapps deployApp process as the same application works well on a standalone server.</p>
  <p>2. The results table is scrollable lefto to right. The first two fields are always displayed</p>
  <p>3. The map is sometimes a little slow to render, due to latencies of the Google Visualization API. Typically, the results table will appear first and the map will complete rendering in a little while. It may take 2-3 seconds for the map to render. Please be patient.</p>
  <p>4. This application should only be used a tool of research and not as the only factor in making final decisions as it's scope is much narrower than the myriads of considerations students have in choosing their colleges. The data is also historical and is only a reflection of the past and not a real guarantee of the future. Hope it is useful and enlightening to those that use it.</p>
